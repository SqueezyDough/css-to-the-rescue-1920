# CSS to the Rescue @cmda-minor-web 19-20
In this course I will create an interactive webpage using CSS and HTML only. I will build features that are usually done with javascript.

I will have to pick a context and 2 restrictions as an extra challenge. I will have to think of a workaround which ultimately challenge me to be more creative!

## Learning goals:
- You understand the broader scope of CSS: You can show that CSS can be used for more than just styling web pages.
- You understand the progressive enhancement parts of CSS: You can show that you can use the cascade, inheritance and specificity in your project
- You understand the interactive parts of CSS: Is the UX fully enhanced within in given CSS scope?
- You have been experimenting: Have the learning goals been stretched?

## Contexts
Dark-mode

## Restrictions
* Two-colors
* Responsive without media queries

## Stages
The prototype contains several stages. I took a lot of time to create workarounds with HTML and CSS to trigger the next stage.
- [x] Start
- [X] Theme select
- [X] Intro
- [X] Menu
- [X] ERROR
